You fight valiantly and put in your best effort, but you are not the best of soldiers. During a battle, you are overpowered by a much larger Persian soldier, who knocks your Gladius (Roman short sword) out of your hand and wounds you in the leg. Fortunately, before he kills you, your comrades arrive and save you.
