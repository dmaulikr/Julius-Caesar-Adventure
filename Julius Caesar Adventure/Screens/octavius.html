 You are Octavius! Although you may not know much about your history, due to your fierce nature and fighting prowess, Julius Caesar has taken you under his wing. You can be harsh at times, but that is part of what makes you a warrior. Later on, after Caesar is assassinated, you, along with Mark Antony, lead an army against Cassius and the rest of the traitors.
