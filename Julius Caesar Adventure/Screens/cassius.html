You are Cassius! Cunning, shrewd, and manipulative, you are a master puppeteer. Looking back on your life, you can see signs of this – you enjoyed plays with trickery, you enjoyed using your mind over your body. Your intelligence makes you a worthy opponent, but your lack of qualms over using downright devious methods makes you a scary one. Your success in life has come from avoiding head on confrontation and instead choosing to work in the shadows. What is perhaps your most important achievement to date, your senate seat, is a direct result of your puppeteering. In the future, you’ll continue your manipulative ways, spearheading the revolt and assasination of Julius Caesar.
