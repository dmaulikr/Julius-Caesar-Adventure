Ludi Florales (the Festival of Flowers) is approaching and the theater is about to put on a series of shows. There's Homer's <em>Odyssey</em>, about a hero's treacherous journey back home, <em>Curculio</em>, a love story full of trickery, and <em>Psyche and Eros</em>, a story of true love. Which play would you most like to see?
