You are Calpurnia! Growing up, you were a normal high class girl, but recently you seem to have developed a connection to the supernatural. You are able to see omens, and you generally tend to trust your instincts when it comes to them. After all, you can never be too careful. Caesar marries you for your status and looks, knowing nothing of your ability. The night before the ides of March, you have a dream where Caesar's statue pours blood. You tell your husband about it, but because  you are a woman, he discounts your opinion. His loss.
