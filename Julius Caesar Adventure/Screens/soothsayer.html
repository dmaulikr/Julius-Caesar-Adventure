You are the Soothsayer! Because of your intelligent and compassionate nature, and your extraordinary luck, Apollo has given you the secrets of fate. Looking back on your life, it's easy to see how you are gifted. You were easily able to pick the right things in any situation involving chance, and you were also eager to help those in need through peaceful means. Later in your life, you become regarded as one of the wisest soothsayers around, and even Julius Caesar comes to you for help. You tell him to "beware the ides of March," but of course he doesn't listen.
