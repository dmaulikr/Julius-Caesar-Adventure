 You are Flavius! Born into a lower-middle class family, you have made it to the (somewhat) top! Since you were young, you have had a desire to join these ranks, being extremely concerned with appearances. Although you enjoy the trappings of high class society, you are resentful of those above you. When you were younger and witnessed a coming of age ceremony, you disliked it because you couldn’t have one yourself. Later on, you’ll similarly dislike the extravagant celebrations of Julius Caesar, and you, along with your friend Murellus, will go around tearing their decorations down. Unfortunately, this gets you executed.
